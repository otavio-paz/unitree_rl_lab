## Overview

This project provides a set of reinforcement learning environments for Unitree robots, built on top of [IsaacLab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab).

Currently supports Unitree **Go2**, **H1** and **G1-29dof** robots.

## üîÅ Process 

The basic workflow for using reinforcement learning to achieve motion control is:

`Train` ‚Üí `Play` ‚Üí `Sim2Sim` ‚Üí `Sim2Real`

- **Train**: Use the Lab simulation environment to let the robot interact with the environment and find a policy that maximizes the designed rewards. Real-time visualization during training is not recommended to avoid reduced efficiency.
- **Play**: Use the Play command to verify the trained policy and ensure it meets expectations.
- **Sim2Sim**: Deploy the Gym-trained policy to other simulators to ensure it‚Äôs not overly specific to Gym characteristics.
- **Sim2Real**: Deploy the policy to a physical robot to achieve motion control.

## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab by following the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html).
- Install the Unitree RL IsaacLab standalone environments.

  - Clone or copy this repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_lab.git
    ```
  - Use a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library in editable mode using:

    ```bash
    conda activate env_isaaclab
    python -m pip install -e source/unitree_rl_lab
    ```
- Download unitree usd files

  - Download unitree usd files from [unitree_model](https://huggingface.co/datasets/unitreerobotics/unitree_model/tree/main), keeping folder structure
    ```bash
    git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/unitreerobotics/unitree_model
    ```
  - If you don't have [LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage), by default it will clone only references to large files. After installing it, go to the `unitree_model` directory, install LFS and pull the large files.
    ```bash
    git lfs install
    git lfs pull
    ``` 
  - Config `UNITREE_MODEL_DIR` in `source/unitree_rl_lab/unitree_rl_lab/assets/robots/unitree.py`.

    ```bash
    UNITREE_MODEL_DIR = "</home/user/projects/unitree_usd>"
    ```
- Verify that the environments are correctly installed by:

  - Listing the available tasks:

    ```bash
    python unitree_rl_lab/scripts/list_envs.py
    ```

## Train

- Running a task:

  ```bash
  python unitree_rl_lab/scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --headless --task Unitree-G1-29dof-Velocity
  ```

## Play

- Inference with a trained agent:

  ```bash
  python unitree_rl_lab/scripts/rsl_rl/play.py --task Unitree-G1-29dof-Velocity
  ```

## Sim2Sim

After the model training is completed, we need to perform Sim2Sim on the trained strategy in MuJoCo to test the performance of the model.
Then deploy Sim2Real.

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install -y libyaml-cpp-dev libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev libspdlog-dev
# Install unitree_sdk2
git clone git@github.com:unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2.git
cd unitree_sdk2
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF # Install on the /usr/local directory
sudo make install
# Compile the robot_controller
cd deploy/robots/g1_29dof # or other robots
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```

### Sim2Sim

Install the [unitree_mujoco](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

- Set the `robot` at `/simulate/config.yaml` to g1
- Set `domain_id` to 0
- Set `enable_elastic_band` to 1
- Set `use_joystck` to 1.

```bash
# start simulation
cd unitree_mujoco/simulate/build
sudo ./unitree_mujoco
```

```bash
cd unitree_rl_lab/deploy/robots/g1_29dof/build
sudo ./g1_ctrl --network lo
# 1. press [L2 + Up] to set the robot to stand up
# 2. Click the mujoco window, and then press 8 to make the robot feet touch the ground.
# 3. Press [R1 + X] to run the policy.
# 4. Click the mujoco window, and then press 9 to disable the elastic band.
```

### Sim2Real

You can use this program to control the robot directly, but make sure the on-board control program has been closed.

```bash
sudo ./g1_ctrl --network <eth0/enp2s0/etc> # the network interface name.
```
